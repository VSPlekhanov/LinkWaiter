# LinkWaiter

This is a small python script using the Selenium framework.
I wrote this script when I had distance exams during COVID-19 at my university.
My whole group had to wait until the link to the exam appeared on the university's website. We updated the page again and again. Then I automated this process and shared this script with my bandmates.
